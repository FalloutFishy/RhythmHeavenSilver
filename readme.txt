Hi, I'm Shaffy from the Rhythm Tengoku translation team. 
And I'll explain you how to use this source code.

1) First put an normal Rhythm Tengoku ROM (JPN) onto the "ROM" folder and rename it "rh-jpn.gba".
2) Execute the "compile.bat" file (or the "fast_compile.bat" but graphics won't be compiled or outdated)
3) And you're ROM should be ready onto the "ROM" folder, called "rh-eng.gba".

If it doesn't work please contact us at this discord server:
