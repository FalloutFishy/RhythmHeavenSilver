Those tools have no documentation and were created by various people at multiple years interval, some of them really are trial-and-error.

However from what I remember:
- 4BPP to OAM: Add a padding to any file you give to it for it to work with the RhythmHeavenOAMEditor.
- nmap: Texture extractor(?)
- RhythmHeavenOAMEditor: It's in the name.

The IPS adds probably some obscure binhacks for some emulator (vba?) to log the location of the sprite.
And the Lua script probably is the thing that works with it.
