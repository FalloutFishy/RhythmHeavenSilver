# RhythmTengokuENPatch
Rhythm Tengoku English Patch is a project started in 2011/2012 to translate the exclusive JAP game Rhythm Tengoku in english for making it be playable for everyone, and was restarted in 2019 by another guy (me).
Feel free to contribute.
Thanks to W hat and the EN team for making this. Thanks to Malalaika for the Debug_Menu.ips patch. Thanks to you for playing the game and using the patch
